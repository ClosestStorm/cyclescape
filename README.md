# Cycle Campaigning Toolkit

This toolkit is a Ruby on Rails web application created to facilitate cycle campaigning.

The software has been developed to power the [Cyclescape](http://www.cyclescape.org)
campaigning website, and you can help improve it or take the software and customise
it for your own needs.

It is split into two main sections:

* Reporting a problem: a section open to anyone
* Managing and solving problems: for campaigners and groups

The toolkit aims to have the following outcomes:

* Fundamentally, increased resolution of problems on the street/path network and therefore an improved cycling environment
* Improved and better-organised working practices by local groups around the country through access to a new tool to help them manage the deluge of cycling problems that they get told about or wish to see resolved
* Increased reporting of network deficiencies, i.e. increased involvement of local people
* Increased awareness of problems faced by cyclists
* Improved working relationships between campaign groups and Local Authorities (a common problem)
* Increased ability for Local Authorities to justify central government investment
* Increased demonstration of partnership working between Local Authorities and local people
* Potentially, consolidation of existing web-based systems, reducing the need for groups to maintain custom-written and highly-specific systems.

The toolkit is being created by CycleStreets, who run the UK-wide cycle journey planner (at [cyclestreets.net](http://www.cyclestreets.net)), run ‘for cyclists, by cyclists’. As well as the cycle journey planner, which has planned almost a million routes in the UK, the CycleStreets website includes a Photomap campaigning tool used by cyclists to report problems and good practice, by locating photographs on a map.

# Project Development
